# Alireza's "Dotfiles"



**Hey, there!**



This Repository **Dotfiles** contain my personal config files. Here you'll find configs, customizations, themes, and whatever I need to personalize my mac OS experience.

I created them as free resources to be used in your specific use cases. If you're searching for detailed, in-depth tutorials on some tools or technologies, check out my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@christianlempa).
